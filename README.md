iCook reduces the time it takes to find a recipe. iCook utilizes a mySQL database to store the ingredients found in a users’ pantry. A user is be able to add ingredients, update existing ingredients, and delete ingredients from iCook’s interface. Recipes are stored within the database and contain information regarding the required ingredients as well as instructions on how to prep the dish. Most importantly, users are able to search for all available recipes that can be prepared given the user’s current inventory. iCook benefits its users by providing multiple recipes that they may not have known/thought about.
