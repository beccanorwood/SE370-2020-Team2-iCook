iCook reduces the time it takes to find a recipe, and by utilizing a **MySQL** database to store the ingredients found in a user's pantry as well as their available recipes, users are provided multiple recipes that they may not have known/thought about. A user is be able to add/update/delete ingredients from iCook’s user interface. Recipes are stored within the database and contain information regarding the required ingredients as well as instructions on how to prep the dish. Most importantly, users are able to search for all available recipes that can be prepared given the user’s current inventory. Following SE 471's curriculum, iCook implements 4 new design patterns: **Builder, Prototype, Decorator,** and **State** design patterns. Alongside these 4 newly added design patterns, iCook implements the **Singleton, Facade,** and **DAO** design patterns.
